# Passlock

## A python application that helps in storage and encryption of passwords. 
### By Norbert Lupamo Anjichi.

### How It Works 
The passlock application allows a new user to create an account, to be able to log in
, and to be able to log-out.
We use shortened codes to implement this commands.
* NU - New User for new users to create accounts.
* Li -- Log in for registered users.
* Lu --- Log out and exit the password locker.
